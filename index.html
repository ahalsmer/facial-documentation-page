      <code>Cleansing</code>
      </header>
    <p>Cleansing is arguably the most important step in your skincare routine. You want a cleanser that effectively removes all dirt and makeup without stripping too much of your skin's natural barrier. One way to help you find the right products for this is to determine your skin type.
      </p>
      <p>
      One easy way to determine skin type is to take toilet paper square and rip into one ply then sticks pieces of it to your forehead, chin, and cheeks. If all of them stick, you probably have oily skin. If just the ones on your forehead and chin stick, it means you have an oily T-zone and combination skin. If none of them stick, you have normal or dry skin; you'll know the difference. 
    </p>
    <p>If you have oily skin, a good cleansing combo to melt even the glamest of looks would be a balm or cream cleanser followed by a gentle gel or foam cleanser. If you have combination skin, a balm cleanser followed by a cream-to-foam cleanser would be ideal for retaining moisture in your dry areas. This routine also works well for normal skin. Normal to dry to skin peeps should use a gentle oil cleanser followed by a cream cleanser.</p>

      <code>Exfoliate</code>
      </header>
    <p>Regular exfoliation is necessary for all skin types, but you should be aware of your skin is sensitive or prone to break outs. Exfoliation should not be done dail but rather once or twice weekly. If you happen to have sensitive skin, manual exfoliation techniques will suit your skin best. Manual exfoliation methods include using an exfoliation brush or cloth with your regular cleanser. if you want to take this to the next level, you can even invest in a personal microdermabrasion machine and use that for deep exfoliation.</p>
    <p>If your skin is not proned to break outs, you can use manual exfoliation or chemical exfoliation. Chemical exfoliation icludes exfoliating toners and peels. These actually can be used daily or every other day if your skin feels irritation. As usual, this can be done after your cleansing step.</p>

      <code>Massage</code>
      </header>
    <p>Massage can be one of the least utilized yet most influential upgrades to your skin care routine. For normal to dry skin, a massage cream or oil will work nicely. For combination and oily, a massage cream will be ideal. You can also use massage tools like jade rollers and gua sha stones.</p>
    <p>Facial massages can help tone the face, reduce sagging, clear sinuses, and promote collagen production. YouTube is a great resource for educating yourself in massage movements and techniques. Although upward and outward strokes with your fingers going from the center region of the face is one way to give yourself an anti-aging massage, utilizing a jade roller for a lymphatic drainage massage or performing a gua sha technique and tool will be even more effective in sculpting and improving complexion. </p>

      <code>Mask</code>
      </header>
    <p>A facial mask is not always necessary in your routine, but it is a nice way to bring the luxurious feeling of a facial home. If you're on the oilier side or your pores are feeling congested, a clay or peel mask would be ideal for your skin. If you have normal or dry skin, sheet masks and overnight masks are great option to bring some moisture and nourishment back into your skin. With product masks, you can apply the mask as a spot treatment for your problem areas. With sheet and product masks, you can keep your mask in the fridge to provide and instant soothing and de-puffing effect to the skin.</p>

      <code>Serum</code>
      </header>
    <p>Facial serums come with many options for different skin concerns. Most often it is best for most skin types to reserve their active ingreients for this step. If you struggle with scarring or dull skin, Vitamin C serums would be ideal for brightening your skin tone. If your skin is on the sensitive side and dull, products with ingredients, like reveratrol, mushroom extract, or snail mucin, can provide similar effects to the Vitamin serum or a retinol serum. For maturing skin, products including retinol will help in reducing fine lines and slow the sagging of skin. There are also plenty of serums with hyaluronic acid and other moisturizing or soothing ingredients that are great for irritated or dry skin. To see the most effects out of your serums, it would be most beneficial to only keep one or two of them in your daily routine.</p>

      <code>Moisturizer</code>
      </header>
    <p>Moisturizing can bring life back to your skin, and yet, moisturizing is one of the most frequently neglected steps in people's skin care routines.For oily and combination skin, a gel or light cream moisturizer would be ideal. For normal to dry skin, a cream moisturizer will give your skin a healthy glow. Some tips in moisturizing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For people with combination skin, cream moisturizers can also be effective if you focus your application on the drier portions of our face while applying to the oiler portions with a lighter hand.</li>
      <li>If you're moisturizer is too thick or you're in a crunch for time, you can mix your mositurizer with a little serum to minimize oiliness and maximize skin benefits!</li>
      <li>When performing your morning skincare routine, make sure to follow the application of your moisturizer with some kind of SPF. Protecting your skin from the sun can minimize signs of aging, scarring, and hyperpigmentation.</li>
